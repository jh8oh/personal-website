          Hello! I'm Ji Ho Oh (오지호) but I also go by Jay. I'm a 3rd-year
          undergrad at the University of Waterloo.<br /><br />
          I like creating user-facing software mostly because I want the things
          I make to look
          <span><em>a e s t h e t i c</em></span
          >. This has led to me building websites, Android applications, and
          games. At the moment, I am focusing on learning new libraries and
          frameworks over specializing in one specific aspect. However, I am
          also looking for a field that might capture my interest and allow me
          to dive deeper.<br /><br />Aside from coding, my hobbies include
          playing video games, reading manga, and world-building.
